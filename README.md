# Flapping-Wings-Model-Project
A mechanism proposal for design of Flapping Wing Air Vehicles

In this paper, we will focus on the mechanism to be used for the design of a flapping wing micro air 
vehicle (MAV) and see how it can be much more efficient than simple rotor based designed air 
vehicles. Here we use Whitworth Quick Return Mechanism, an inversion of single slider crank 
mechanism, to acquire the desired result. It is set such that the up-stroke of the wing is the forward 
stroke and the down-stroke is the return stroke (quicker) which creates resultant downward thrust 
thus generating an upward force which helps in lifting of the vehicle. 
The idea of ‘flapping wings’ is inspired from nature itself, which is observed in the motion of birds. 
Flapping wings may offer improved efficiency, better maneuverability, and reduced noise compared 
with the rotary-driven air vehicles. The resemblance to a real bird can also make it unrecognizable 
and make it handy for secret military intelligence missions. The drones built, if fitted with camera 
can also be useful in areas like security surveillance.
